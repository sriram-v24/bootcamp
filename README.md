DAY 2:This section helps me recall HTML and CSS, practice, refine the project, and perfect fundamental web development concepts, tags, and basic styling.

DAY 3:I learned more about CSS, basic Bootstrap, CSS animations, and how to handle responsive websites. I also recalled and practiced my development skills. Additionally, I learned many things from my friends and shared some knowledge with them

DZY 4:I only knew JavaScript concepts but had little experience implementing them. In this session, I practiced applying my knowledge, fixing errors, and improving my skills. It wasn't easy for me, but I kept learning and trying repeatedly to develop a clear understanding of JavaScript.
